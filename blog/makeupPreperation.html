            <p>Great makeup starts with great skin. Preparing your skin properly before applying makeup can ensure that your makeup looks its best and lasts all day. Follow these steps to prep your skin for a flawless makeup application.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Cleanse Your Skin</h2>
            <p>Begin by cleansing your face to remove any dirt, oil, and impurities. Use a gentle cleanser that suits your skin type to avoid irritation. A clean canvas is essential for smooth and even makeup application.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Exfoliate</h2>
            <p>Exfoliating your skin helps remove dead skin cells and smooth out your complexion. Use a mild exfoliator once or twice a week to keep your skin looking fresh and radiant. Avoid harsh scrubs that can damage your skin.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Moisturize</h2>
            <p>Hydrated skin is key to flawless makeup. Apply a moisturizer suited to your skin type to keep your skin plump and smooth. Allow the moisturizer to fully absorb before moving on to the next step.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Prime Your Skin</h2>
            <p>Using a primer helps create a smooth base for your makeup and can improve its longevity. Choose a primer that addresses your specific skin concerns, such as mattifying for oily skin or hydrating for dry skin.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Protect with Sunscreen</h2>
            <p>Always apply sunscreen, even if your makeup contains SPF. Sunscreen protects your skin from harmful UV rays and prevents premature aging. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and allow it to absorb before applying your makeup.</p>
