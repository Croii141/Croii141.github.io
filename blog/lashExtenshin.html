            <p>Not all lash extensions are created equal. Finding the right style to enhance your eye shape can make a significant difference in your overall look. Follow this guide to choose the best type and style of lash extensions for your unique eye shape.</p>

            <h2>Determining Your Eye Shape</h2>
            <p>First, identify your eye shape. Common eye shapes include almond, round, hooded, and monolid. Knowing your eye shape helps in selecting lash extensions that will complement and enhance your natural features.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Lash Extensions for Almond Eyes</h2>
            <p>If you have almond-shaped eyes, you're in luck! This versatile eye shape can pull off a variety of lash styles. Consider cat-eye lash extensions to accentuate your natural shape or opt for a doll-eye style for a more dramatic look.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Lash Extensions for Round Eyes</h2>
            <p>For round eyes, choose lash extensions that add length and create an elongated effect. A cat-eye style with longer lashes at the outer corners can help balance the roundness and give your eyes a more almond-like appearance.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Lash Extensions for Hooded Eyes</h2>
            <p>Hooded eyes benefit from lash extensions that open up the eyes. Opt for extensions with a mix of lengths to add volume and lift. Avoid overly heavy lashes that can make your eyes appear smaller.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Lash Extensions for Monolid Eyes</h2>
            <p>For monolid eyes, choose lash extensions that add volume and curl. A natural curl with a mix of lengths can create depth and enhance your eye shape. Avoid straight or heavy lashes that can weigh down your eyes.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Consult with a Professional</h2>
            <p>When in doubt, consult with a professional lash technician. They can assess your eye shape and recommend the best style and type of lash extensions for you. A professional can also ensure that the application is done safely and effectively.</p>
