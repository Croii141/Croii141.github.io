            <p>Sunscreen is a crucial step in any skincare routine. It protects your skin from harmful UV rays, preventing premature aging and reducing the risk of skin cancer. Learn why you should never skip sunscreen and how to incorporate it into your daily regimen.</p>

            <h2>Protection Against UV Rays</h2>
            <p>Sunscreen shields your skin from the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays. There are two types of UV rays: UVA and UVB. UVA rays can prematurely age your skin, causing wrinkles and age spots, while UVB rays can burn your skin. Both types can cause skin cancer.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Prevents Premature Aging</h2>
            <p>Consistent use of sunscreen can prevent the early signs of aging. Sun exposure can lead to the breakdown of collagen and elastin in your skin, resulting in wrinkles, fine lines, and sagging skin. Sunscreen helps maintain your skin's youthful appearance.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Reduces Risk of Skin Cancer</h2>
            <p>Regular application of sunscreen significantly lowers your risk of developing skin cancer, including melanoma, which is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. By protecting your skin from harmful UV radiation, you reduce your risk of skin damage and disease.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Prevents Sunburn</h2>
            <p>Sunburn not only causes immediate discomfort but can also have long-term effects on your skin's health. Repeated sunburns increase the risk of skin cancer and can lead to more severe skin damage over time. Sunscreen helps prevent painful and harmful sunburns.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>How to Use Sunscreen Properly</h2>
            <p>Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30. Apply it generously to all exposed skin 15 minutes before going outside, and reapply every two hours, or immediately after swimming or sweating. Don't forget areas like your ears, neck, and the tops of your feet.</p>
