        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 1: Prep Your Skin</h2>
            <p>Great makeup starts with great skin. Begin by cleansing and moisturizing your face to create a smooth base. Apply a primer to help your makeup last longer and create a flawless finish.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 2: Apply Foundation</h2>
            <p>Choose a foundation that matches your skin tone and type. Use a makeup sponge or brush to apply foundation evenly across your face, blending it well into your skin. Don't forget to blend into your neck for a seamless look.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 3: Conceal and Highlight</h2>
            <p>Use a concealer to cover any blemishes, dark circles, or imperfections. Apply a lighter shade of concealer to highlight areas like under your eyes, the bridge of your nose, and your forehead. Blend well for a natural finish.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 4: Set with Powder</h2>
            <p>Set your foundation and concealer with a translucent powder to prevent creasing and shine. Use a fluffy brush to apply the powder lightly, focusing on areas that tend to get oily.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 5: Add Color</h2>
            <p>Apply blush to the apples of your cheeks for a healthy glow. Use bronzer to contour your face, adding warmth and definition. Finish with a highlighter on the high points of your face for a radiant finish.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 6: Define Your Eyes</h2>
            <p>Use eyeshadow to add depth and dimension to your eyes. Apply eyeliner to define your lash line, and finish with mascara to make your lashes look longer and fuller. Fill in your brows for a polished look.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Step 7: Perfect Your Lips</h2>
            <p>Choose a lip color that complements your look. Apply lip liner to define your lips and prevent your lipstick from feathering. Fill in with your chosen lipstick or lip gloss, and blot with a tissue for long-lasting color.</p>
