            <h2>Sheet Masks</h2>
            <p>Sheet masks are pre-soaked in a serum and are designed for a single-use application. They provide intense hydration and are great for a quick skincare boost. Simply apply the sheet to your face, leave it on for 15-20 minutes, and then remove and pat the remaining serum into your skin.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Clay Masks</h2>
            <p>Clay masks are ideal for oily and acne-prone skin. They help absorb excess oil, unclog pores, and reduce inflammation. Apply a thin layer of the clay mask to your face, let it dry for about 10-15 minutes, and then rinse off with warm water.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Gel Masks</h2>
            <p>Gel masks are soothing and hydrating, making them perfect for sensitive or irritated skin. They often contain ingredients like aloe vera and cucumber, which help calm and cool the skin. Apply a generous layer to your face, leave it on for 15-20 minutes, and rinse off with cool water.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Exfoliating Masks</h2>
            <p>Exfoliating masks contain ingredients like alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) that help remove dead skin cells and promote cell turnover. Use these masks once or twice a week for a brighter, smoother complexion. Apply, leave on for the recommended time, and rinse off thoroughly.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Cream Masks</h2>
            <p>Cream masks are rich and moisturizing, ideal for dry or mature skin. They provide deep hydration and nourishment, leaving your skin feeling soft and supple. Apply a thick layer, leave it on for the specified time, and then rinse off or wipe away any excess.</p>
