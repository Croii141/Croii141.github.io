            <h2>Regular Trimming</h2>
            <p>Regular trimming is key to maintaining a well-groomed beard or mustache. Use quality trimmers and scissors to keep your facial hair at your desired length and shape. Trimming not only keeps your beard looking neat but also promotes healthier hair growth.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Moisturize and Condition</h2>
            <p>Just like the hair on your head, your beard and mustache need to be moisturized and conditioned. Use beard oil or balm to keep the hair soft and the skin underneath hydrated. This helps prevent dryness, itching, and flakiness.</p>

        <div class="article-section">
            <h2>Shape and Style</h2>
            <p>Shaping and styling your beard or mustache can enhance your overall look. Use a comb to detangle and shape your facial hair. Consider using styling products like beard wax to hold the shape in place. Experiment with different styles to find what suits you best.</p>

            <h2>Maintain Cleanliness</h2>
            <p>Keeping your beard and mustache clean is essential for good grooming. Wash your facial hair regularly with a gentle beard shampoo to remove dirt and excess oil. Follow up with a conditioner to keep the hair soft and manageable.</p>
