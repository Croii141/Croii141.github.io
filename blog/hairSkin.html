            <p>Finding the right hair color can be transformative. The right shade can enhance your natural beauty and complement your skin tone, giving you a fresh, vibrant look. Here are some tips to help you choose the perfect hair color for your skin tone.</p>

            <h2>Understanding Your Skin Tone</h2>
            <p>First, determine whether your skin tone is warm, cool, or neutral. One way to do this is by looking at the veins on your wrist. If they appear blue, you have cool undertones. If they appear green, you have warm undertones. If you see a mix of both, you have neutral undertones.</p>

            <h2>Choosing the Right Shades</h2>
            <p>For cool undertones, opt for shades like platinum blonde, ash brown, or cool-toned reds. These colors will complement your skin's natural hues. If you have warm undertones, consider golden blonde, caramel, or copper shades. These colors will enhance the warmth of your skin. Neutral undertones can pull off a wide range of colors, so feel free to experiment!</p>
