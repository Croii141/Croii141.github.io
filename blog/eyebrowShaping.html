            <h2>Finding Your Ideal Brow Shape</h2>
            <p>To find your ideal brow shape, start by identifying the natural shape of your brows. Use a brow pencil to map out where your brows should start, arch, and end. Generally, your brows should start at the bridge of your nose, arch over the middle of your eye, and end at the outer corner of your eye.</p>
